# Decision 9: Team Organizational Structure

## Status
✅ RESOLVED | Date: Oct 31, 2025 | Priority: P1

## Decision
**Choice**: Hub-and-spoke (no additional hierarchy)

**Structure**: Human → Project Manager → Orchestrator (Hub) → Agents (Spokes)

**Rationale**: Orchestrator architecture already creates natural hub-and-spoke, prevents role confusion, clear communication paths
