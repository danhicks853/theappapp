## What is TheAppApp?

TheAppApp is an autonomous AI development platform that builds software projects from start to finish using a team of specialized AI agents.

**Key Features** (Planned):
- 🤖 **10 Specialized AI Agents** - Backend, Frontend, QA, Security, DevOps, and more
- 🧠 **Intelligent Orchestrator** - Coordinates agent work and makes strategic decisions
- 🎯 **Human-in-the-Loop** - Critical decisions require your approval
- 📚 **RAG-Based Learning** - Learns from past projects to improve over time
- 🔒 **Permission-Controlled Tools** - Secure access to GitHub, Docker, databases
- 💰 **Cost Tracking** - Monitor LLM token usage and costs in real-time

## Vision

Describe your project to TheAppApp, and watch as a coordinated team of AI agents:
1. Plans the architecture
2. Writes the code
3. Creates comprehensive tests
4. Deploys to production

All with human oversight at critical checkpoints.
